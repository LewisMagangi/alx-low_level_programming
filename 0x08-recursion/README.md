0-puts_recursion.c: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

1-print_rev_recursion.c: A function that prints a string in reverse.

2-strlen_recursion.c: A function that returns the length of a string.

3-factorial.c: A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
	     . If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
	     . Factorial of 0 is 1

4-pow_recursion.c: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
		 . If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

5-sqrt_recursion.c: A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
		  . If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1

6-is_prime_number.c: A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

100-is_palindrome.c: A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
		   . An empty string is a palindrome

101-wildcmp.c: A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
	     . Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2); 
	     . s2 can contain the special character *.
	     . The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
